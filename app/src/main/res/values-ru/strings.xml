    <!---Topic 1- Know BP Numbers-->
    <string name="topic_1">Know BP Numbers &amp; Normal Range</string>

    <string name="paragraph_1">What range can be determined as hypertension? If one of your readings reaches the standard for high blood pressure, but the other one does not, how to detrmine that? To define your blood pressure numbers, you can see the blood pressure category below.</string>

    <string name="main_2">1.Hypotension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_2">If your readings are less than 90/60 mmHg, you are probably hypotensive. You do not need any treatment as low blood pressure causes no harm and no symptoms usually. However, when your blood pressure often drops suddenly over 20 mmHg, falls suddenly due to some medications, or you feel dizzy, fainting, fatigue,etc., you ought to seek treatment.</string>

    <string name="main_3">2.Normal Range</string>
    <string name="paragraph_3">if your readings are higher than 90/60 mmHg and less than 120/80 mmHg, your blood pressure is normal. You need to maintain or adopt a healthy lifestyle to prevent hypertension from developing.\n\nBesides, if you have any family members who have hypertension, it is recommended to be even more mindful of your lifestyle as your risk of developing hypertension can be high.</string>

    <string name="main_4">3.Elevated</string>
    <string name="paragraph_4">When your blood pressure is higher than the normal one but doesn\'t reach 130/80 mmHg, your BP is considered elevated. If your lifestyle and eating habits are not improved, you are very likely to develop high blood pressure.</string>

    <string name="main_5">4.Hypertension Stage 1</string>
    <string name="paragraph_5">Consistent systolic pressure readings between 130 to 139 mmHg or diastolic pressure readings between 80 to 89 mmHg means you are at hypertension stage 1.\n\nGenerally speaking, you only need to improve your lifestyle  to control blood pressure. However, if you have a high risk of cardiovascular disease(heart disease, stroke, etc.), you need to start taking medicine accordingly.</string>

    <string name="main_6">5.Hypertension Stage 2</string>
    <string name="paragraph_6">Hypertension stage 2 is when you have consistent  systolic pressure readings between 140 to 180 mmHg or diastolic pressure readings between 90 to 120 mmHg.\n\nAt this stage, you should combine lifestyle changes and one or more medications. After the first month of treatment and lifestyle improvement, if your blood pressure is under control, you can go to the hospital for another measurement in 3 to 6 months. If the blood pressure is higher or does not change, you need to consult a doctor to change to other treatments.</string>

    <string name="main_7">6.Hypertension Crisis</string>
    <string name="paragraph_7">If you are measuring your blood pressure at home and see your systolic reading over 180 mmHg or diastolic number above 120 mmHg, you need to calm down at first then wait a few minutes to retest it. If you are still in the range of the hypertension crisis, don\'t hesitate to call the emergency service or go to the hospital right now.</string>


    <!---Topic 2- Learn about Blood Pressure-->

    <string name="paragraph_8">Whether you measure your blood pressure at home or in the hospital, you must be puzzled what does blood pressure mean or by the two columns of numbers on the device screen. Don\'t worry, after reading this article. all will be answered.</string>

    <string name="main_9">What is blood pressure?</string>
    <string name="paragraph_9">The heart is like a water pump, conntinuously pumping blood to the blood vessels throughout the body. When blood runs, it pushes against the walls of blood vessels. The strength of pusing is namely blood pressure.</string>

    <string name="main_10">What are two numbers on the BP device</string>
    <string name="paragraph_10">Two readings on your blood pressure monitor represent systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The top or the first number is systolic BP, meaning the amount of pressure in the arteries when your heart pushes blood through arteries. The bottom or second number is the diastolic one, referring to the pressure in arteries when your heart is between beats.</string>


    <!---Topic 3- Find your blood pressure type-->
    <string name="topic_3">Find your blood pressure type</string>

    <string name="main_11">Hypertension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_11">The human cardiovascular system seems like a water circulatory system, in which blood circulates constantly like water and transports oxygen and nutrition to organs and blood vessels.\n\nBlood flow becomes difficult when blood vessels lose their elasticity. At that time, your body tries to increase the strength of pushing to make blood flows, which causes hypertension.</string>

    <string name="main_12">Hypotension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_12">If your blood pressure consistently lowers 90/60 mmHg or falls suddenly over 20 mmHg, you should keep an eye on your blood pressure. Hypotension with no symptons usually doesn\'t need treatment. Nevertheless, accurate diagnosis and categorized therapies are needed if symptoms or sudden fall emerges.</string>


    <!---Topic 4- Break blood pressure misbeliefs-->
    <string name="topic_4">Break Blood Pressure Misbeliefs</string>

    <string name="paragraph_13">You may hear all kinds of myths about blood pressure. Believing in these myths can really make your blood pressure control vain or even make your situation worse. Below are 7 common misunderstands concerning blood pressure. Check out the following and stop believing them.</string>

    <string name="main_14">1. No worries if I have the low blood pressure</string>
    <string name="paragraph_14">Generally speaking, if you have hypotension, some small lifestyle changes can solve the problem. However, if you experience a sudden fall of over 20 mmHg or feel fainting, fatigue, blurred vision, etc., you are in need of professional treatment. If not treated immediately, the hypotension can be life-threatening.</string>

    <string name="main_15">2. I don\'t have hypertension if no symptoms emerge</string>
    <string name="paragraph_15">Do you know that hypertension is called the silent killer? It often run silent and may have no symptoms, or the symptoms may be mild, which will not be taken seriously while it is causing great damage to your health.\n\nWhen the symptoms appear, it indicates that the heart, brain, kidney, blood vessel or other organs have been severely damaged and cannot maintain normal functions. At that time, the optimal treatment opportunity has been missed. Meanwhile, complications are developed and life is under threat.</string>

    <string name="main_16">3. High blood pressure can be cured</string>
    <string name="paragraph_16">Only secondary hypertension can be cured as it has a clear cause. When the secondary condition is cured, secondary hypertension will not last anymore.\n\nPrimary hypertension cannot be healed yet, but it is possible to prevent or decrease its harm to the body by controlling blood pressure to normal through medications or improving lifestyle. The claim that high blood pressure can be cured by simple methods and never relapse is deceptive.</string>

    <string name="main_17">4. Drinking red wine benefits blood pressure control</string>
    <string name="paragraph_17">Myth has it that resveratrol inside the red wine can maintain cardiac health. However, no study can prove that statement. If the resveratrol really could protect your cardiac health, you need to drink an excessive amount of red wine to achieve the effect, which could harm your body badly. Besides, alcohol has proven to be of no benefit to the cardiovascular system.</string>

    <string name="main_18">5. I can stop taking medicines if my blood pressure is under control</string>
    <string name="paragraph_18">This is totally wrong and can be misleading. Primary hypertension can never be cured and most patients need to take medication all their lives. Your blood pressure under control is thr result of drug control, not that high blood pressure has been cured. Once the drug is stopped, blood pressure is likely to rebound. Moreover, quit taking certain drugs will cause serious withdrawal reactions.\n\nSo even if your blood pressure has been stable for a long time, your medication should not be changes or stopped without proper guidance. Consult the doctor before making any changes to the medication. You should reduce the amount of medication under your doctor\'s guidance, monitor blood pressure regularly, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</string>

    <string name="main_19">6. Young people will not get hypertension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_19">Although patients with hypertension are common among middle-aged and elderly people, young people can also suffer from it. The level of blood pressure is affected by age, body size, level of sexual development, lifestyle, etc.</string>

    <string name="main_20">7. Only men can develop hypertension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_20">the risk difference between men and women actually depends on age. Before the age of 45, men are at greater risk of hypertension than women. Between the ages of 45 and 64, they have almost the same risk. It is worth noting that after 64 years old, women\'s risk of getting high blood pressure is higher than men\'s.</string>


    <!---Topic 5- Hypertension Types You Must know-->
    <string name="topic_5">Hypertension Types You Must Know</string>

    <string name="paragraph_21">Do you know there are two main types of high blood pressure? One is primary and another one is secondary high blood pressure. They have different causes and let\'s read on to know more about them.</string>

    <string name="main_22">Primary Hypertension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_22">The most common hypertension is the primary type. It means a consistently high blood pressure not related to another medical condition. Despite years of research on hypertension, a specific cause isn\'t known. Unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, being overnight or obese,etc. could elevate your blood pressure.\n\nPatients\' blood pressure will rise as age increases. The curing method has nor been found until now. Therefore, most patients need to take medication to control blood pressure all life long.</string>

    <string name="main_23">Secondary Hypertension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_23">Only about 5 to 10 percent of hypertension is the secondary type. Besides, it is proved that younger people are likely to have secondary hypertension.\n\nSecondary hypertension is caused by certain medications such as birth control pills, etc., or various conditions like obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease, adrenal gland tumors, thyroid problems, blood vessels defects, etc. When patients stop taking the medicine or cure the secondary condition, secondary hypertension will get better.</string>


    <!---Topic 6- Notice symptoms-->
    <string name="topic_6">Notice Symptoms Of Hypertension</string>

    <string name="main_24">1. Headache</string>
    <string name="paragraph_24">Headache led by high blood pressure usually indicates an emergency. When the blood pressure is too high, it can damage the blood vessels of your brain, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure. You will have pulsating headaches on both sides of your head and any activity will make the headache worse.</string>

    <string name="main_25">2. Dizziness</string>
    <string name="paragraph_25">Although dizziness may be a side effect of taking antihypertensive medication, you should not take it for granted. Severe high blood pressure is a major cause of stroke. Sudden dizziness, loss of balance or unsteady walking can all be a sign of stroke.</string>

    <string name="main_26">3. Nausea</string>
    <string name="paragraph_26">If you are a person with hypertension and experience sudden nausea and loss of appetite, you may come across a hypertensive crisis. Nausea caused by extremely high blood pressure usually happens together with dizziness.</string>

    <string name="main_27">4. Shortness of breath</string>
    <string name="paragraph_27">High blood pressure will affect heart and lung function, leading to shortness of breath. When patients exercise, that could be more noticeable.</string>

    <string name="main_28">5. Chest pain</string>
    <string name="paragraph_28">Hypertension is a leading risk factor for heart attack and heart failure. High blood pressure hardens arteries, bringing difficult blood flow and oxygen delivery. It means less blood reaching the heart and eventually invoking chest pain, also called angina.</string>

    <string name="main_29">6. Blurred vision</string>
    <string name="paragraph_29">There are many small vessels on your eyeballs. When your blood pressure rises to a dangerous level, these vessels can be damaged to bleed, which causes blurred vision or even loss of vision.</string>

    <string name="main_89">7. Nosebleed</string>
    <string name="paragraph_89">Hypertension usually doesn\'t cause nosebleed unless your blood pressure is extremely high. The bleeding means vessels inside your nose are damaged. At this point, you need to call an ambulance or go to the hospital immediately.</string>

    <!---Topic 7- Know problems hypertension brings-->
    <string name="topic_7">Know Problems Hypertension Brings</string>

    <string name="paragraph_30">High blood pressure is a big threat to your health. It can steadily damage your heart, brain, kidney and eyes with no symptoms. If you want to know hypertension\'s effects on your body, read below to get a clear view.</string>

    <string name="main_31">1. Hypertension leads to heart diseases</string>
    <string name="paragraph_31">High blood pressure can cause coronary heart disease, heart failure, etc. Some studies illustrate that about a quater of heart failure cases are caused by high blood pressure.\nHypertension will make arteries less flexible and cause fatty substances to block blood vessels, which indicates smooth blood flow to the heart becomes impossible. At that time, the heart needs to make the left ventricle work harder and pump blood to various organs.\n\nEventually, the extra workload will cause the left ventricle to expand, which greatly increases the risk of developing heart diseases. On the other hand, the heart becomes weak and is not able to pump blood, leading to heart failure.</string>

    <string name="main_32">2. Hypertension can be damage your brain</string>
    <string name="paragraph_32">High blood pressure can cause transient ischemic atatck, strok, dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and other brain diseases.\n\nRaises blood pressure will block arteries and limit blood reaching the brain. The brain could not function when it is short of blood supply, leading to transient ischemic attack(TIA).\n\nExcessive blood pressure leads to brain blood vessels losing their flexibility. This phenomenon makes it impossible for nutrients and oxygen to be transported to the brain, which causes brain cells to die and stroke occurs. the higher your blood pressure is, the greater your chance of developing a stroke. Studies have shown that high blood pressure can boost the risk of stroke in men by 220%.\n\nExcept for TIA and strokr, high blood pressure can also result in vascular sclerosis of your cognitive area. That means patients can be affected with cognitive impairment and gradually may develop into dementia.</string>

    <string name="main_33">3. Hypertension will cause kidney problems</string>
    <string name="paragraph_33">Kidney and blood pressure are closely linked. The blood carries metabolic waste through the kidneys. A healthy kidney filters about half a cup of blood every minute, dicharging excess water and metabolic waste as urine.\n\nTherefore, when the blood pressure is high, the walls of blood vessels will thicken to resist the excessive pressure.</string>

    <string name="main_34">4. Hypertension affects eyesight</string>
    <string name="paragraph_34">Extreme high blood pressure will cause swelling of the retina. Patients will experience blurred vision or even loss of eyesight.\n\nThe retina is at the back of the eye and functions image focusing. When the blood pressure is too high, the blood vessel walls of the retina will thicken and make the blood pressure can damage retinal blood vessels, limit retinal function, and put pressure on the optic nerve, causing vision problems.</string>


    <!---Topic 8- Understand hypotension-->
    <string name="topic_8">Understand Hypotension:Symptoms &amp; Types</string>

    <string name="main_35">Understanding Hypotension Symptoms</string>
    <string name="paragraph_35">Hypotension symptoms include:\n-Blurred vision\n-Dizziness or fainting\n-Inability to concentrate\n-Nausea\n-Rapid breathing\n-Fatigue</string>

    <string name="main_36">Understanding Hypotension Types</string>
    <string name="paragraph_36">If you keep getting these symptoms and wonder the reason, you can get your blood pressure measured and check below to see whether you belong to these types of hypotension.</string>

    <string name="sub_37">1. Orthostatic hypotension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_37">Hypotension caused by rising from a lying down or sitting position to standing is called orthostatic hypotension. It is common as nearly one-fifth of elderly over 65 years old will have it. Besides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, anti-depressants and drugs used to treat parkinson\'s disease can also lead to orthostatic hypotension.</string>

    <string name="sub_38">2. Postprandial hypotension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_38">Postprandial hypotension is often considered a geriatric condition, as it usually appears when older adults finish their eating, and almost no young people will have it.\n\nWhen blood flows to the intestines after a meal, the heart beats faster, while the blood vessels in other parts of the body would constrict to maintain blood pressure. However, some elderly people\'s bodies cannot function normally. When blood flows to the intestines, the heart rate cannot be increased sufficiently, and the vasoconstriction is not enough to maintain blood pressure, which caused a drop a blood pressure.</string>

    <string name="sub_39">3. Neurally mediated hypotension</string>
    <string name="paragraph_39">This type of low blood pressure occurs when the heart and the brain lack communication. People standing for a long time or being very emotional can have neurally mediated hypotension. At that tme, the heart needs to pump blood faster to transport blood to the brain. However, the brain delivers the message that the heart rate should be lowered, which brings blood vessels dilatation of lower body and arms, thereby contributing to not enough blood getting to the brain.</string>
